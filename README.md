Win-Updates
===========

I wrote this script to check for Windows Updates and then email what needs installed.

I used sendEmail because it has a few features I felt were more useful to my needs.

* sendEmail - (http://caspian.dotconf.net/menu/Software/SendEmail/)

After downloading, move sendEmail to C:\Windows and rename it to mail. (Shorter names are always a great idea.)

You can have this run automatically by adding the script to Task Scheduler.

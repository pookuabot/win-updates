Win-Updates
===========

I wrote this script to check for Windows Updates and then email me what needs installed.

I used sendEmail.exe as an easy way to send emails without having to install and configure an email server.

* sendEmail.exe - (http://caspian.dotconf.net/menu/Software/SendEmail/)

After downloading sendEmail.exe, make sure you move it to C:\Windows and then rename it to mail. (Not a must but nice to have a shorter name.)

You can have this run automatically by adding the script to Task Scheduler.
